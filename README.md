commandline-logo
================

Run python's logo (turtle graphics) implementation from command line.
Ultra trivial starter code.

add to bashrc or bash_profile the following line to jump to interpretative python with turtle imported.

    alias LOGO="python -i -c \"from turtle import *\" "

It will then dump you into the python interpreter and you can run commands like:
    fd(50)
    lt(50)
    rt(50)
    lt(50)
    setposition()
    setx()
    sety()
    home()
    pd()
    pu()
    pensize()
    clear()
